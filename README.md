# Mock Yeah

__"An invaluable service mocking platform built on Express."__

Testing is difficult when you don't have control of your data. This project puts you in complete control, enabling you to implement __real mock web services__ with ease. Real mock services means you have control of response payloads, HTTP Status Codes, response latency, and more.

Have a requirement to implement specific behavior when a service is slow to respond or a server returns an unexpected status code? No problem! This platform makes developing for such requirements easy.

## Project Dependencies

Mock Yeah was built and tested with Node v4.2.3.
